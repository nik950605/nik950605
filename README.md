- ⚡ Fun fact: The volume of data generated by various sources is growing exponentially, becoming increasingly diverse and complex. This necessitates efficient tools for their analysis and interpretation. AutoML makes machine learning accessible to a wide range of users, including business analysts, marketers, and engineers who do not have deep knowledge in this field.

AutoML simplifies the model creation process, allowing non-specialists to quickly and effectively solve data analysis and forecasting tasks. It also enables the creation of personalised models for various business tasks, increasing their speed of implementation and accessibility.

The mission of the project is to create innovative tools and platforms for AutoML, making machine learning accessible to everyone. The goal is to accelerate the development, tuning, and deployment of models, improve their accuracy and performance, and reduce the costs of creation and maintenance.

The openness of data and knowledge in AutoML is critically important for accelerating innovation and ensuring transparency. This allows users to better understand and trust the models, and promotes collaboration and experience sharing, ultimately enhancing the quality and effectiveness of solutions.
